# "Ride the Bus" Terminal Game

This demo is a recreation of the Ride the Bus drinking game. It is contained entirely within the terminal and features ASCII-constructed graphics.

I created this demo during my first semester of my first year of college (Fall of 2024) to show my self-taught understanding of python.  
The original—unfinished, but I would say impressive—code is found within the "OLD" folder.  
It contains a fully functioning deck of cards generator, with featureds of shuffling and drawing cards. It also has the framework for terminal graphics.

As of the Spring of 2026, I have begun updating this project so as to fully complete it.  
I have better organized the various python scripts:  
```
deck.py containing the basic deck functions,  
tgfx.py containing the terminal graphics functions, and  
game.py containing the game rules and player-interaction functions.
```
